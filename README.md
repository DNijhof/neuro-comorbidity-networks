# Neuro-Comorbidity Networks

This repository hosts the website and resources for my PhD project:  
**Exploring Molecular Mechanisms of Comorbidity: A Network-Based Analysis of ADHD and Autism**.  

The project uses **network-based systems biology** approaches to investigate genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying comorbidity between neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders.

## 🔎 Project Overview
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are highly comorbid, and may share overlapping molecular mechanisms.  
This project:  
- Curates gene lists linked to ASD (~1600) and ADHD (~350)  
- Focuses on proteins expressed at the neuronal synapse  
- Builds a molecular network from >50 published proteomic studies (SynaptomeDB) 
- Uses **BioNAR** and **SynaptomeDB** to integrate and analyse protein–protein interaction models  

Future extensions may include other conditions, for example **epilepsy** and **schizophrenia**.
